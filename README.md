## Running nf-core/ampliseq

To perform amplicon sequencing analysis using nf-core/ampliseq, run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/ampliseq -r 2.13.0 -name DADA2_AIP_MD -profile conda -params-file nf-params.json
```

This will execute the pipeline with the specified parameters defined in `nf-params.json`.
